This is the final project for the Multiple Classifiers System's class.

## Description

The goal of this project is to implement the proposed method of the paper ["A two-stage ensemble method for the detection of class-label noise"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217317265) and reproduce the experiments in some of the paper datasets, which can be found in the [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html). The experimented datasets were: [Blood](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center), [Breast](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29), [Chess](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chess+%28King-Rook+vs.+King-Pawn%29), [German](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29), [Heart](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29), [Ionosfere](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere), [Parkinsons](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons), [Spambase](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) and [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame).
